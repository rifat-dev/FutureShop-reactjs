        Method:
        Heat 1/2 cup of the broth in a pot until simmering, add saffron and set aside for 10
        minutes.

        Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep skillet over medium-high
        heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly
        browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a large plate and set aside, leaving chicken
        and chorizo in the pan. Add pimentón, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and
        pepper, and cook, stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add
        saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.

        Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with artichokes and peppers, and cook
        without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, add reserved shrimp and mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook
        again without stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7
        minutes more. (Discard any mussels that don’t open.)
